    message: "Comprehensive backend API testing completed. 28/31 tests passed (90.3% success rate). Critical endpoints (health, user management, listings) are working correctly. Main issue: PostGIS query in potential matches endpoint causing 500 errors. Authentication system fixed and working properly. Geographic search functionality working well. Minor validation issues with UUID handling and coordinate validation need attention."

    message: "✅ RETESTING COMPLETE: All previously failing endpoints now working correctly. Fixed PostGIS query in get_potential_matches by converting WKBElement to text format. Fixed UUID parameter handling in like_user and related endpoints. Implemented proper UserMatch creation logic for mutual likes. Success rate improved to 96.8% (30/31 tests passing). Only minor issue remaining: coordinate validation allows invalid coordinates (lat=200, lon=300) but this doesn't break functionality."

    message: "🎯 FRONTEND TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing of all Social Rent App features completed. Frontend is fully implemented with 5 functional tabs. WORKING: Profile editing (✅), Listings with search/favorites (✅), Map with filters (✅), Navigation (✅). ISSUES: Search and Matches tabs have authentication errors (401 Unauthorized) preventing proper loading. Backend API integration mostly working but some endpoints return 401 errors. Overall: 4/5 major features working, 1 authentication issue affecting 2 tabs."
